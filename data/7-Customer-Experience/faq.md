# HeyZack Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is HeyZack?
HeyZack is an AI-powered smart home kit that brings voice control, automation, and intelligent energy management to every home without requiring professional installation. It's designed to make your home smarter, more secure, and more energy-efficient.

### How is HeyZack different from other smart home systems?
HeyZack differentiates itself through:
- **True DIY installation** - no technical skills or professional help needed
- **AI-powered automation** that learns your habits and suggests optimizations
- **Energy efficiency** built into every aspect of the system
- **Unified control** through a single app and voice interface
- **Seamless device integration** without complex setup procedures

### Do I need technical skills to set up HeyZack?
No! HeyZack is designed for easy DIY installation. If you can plug in a device and follow simple app instructions, you can set up HeyZack. Most components are plug-and-play, and the app guides you through the entire process with step-by-step instructions.

### Does HeyZack work with my existing smart home devices?
HeyZack is compatible with many popular smart home ecosystems including Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit. Specific device compatibility depends on the device type and model. Our app will scan your network and identify compatible devices during setup.

### How does the AI automation work?
HeyZack's AI observes your usage patterns and makes suggestions for automations that might be helpful. For example, if it notices you typically turn on the living room lights and adjust the thermostat when you arrive home from work, it might suggest creating an "Arriving Home" automation that does this automatically. You always have control over which suggestions to implement.

### Does HeyZack require a subscription?
No. HeyZack works without any subscription fees. All core features are included with your purchase. We may offer optional premium services in the future (like expanded cloud storage for security cameras), but these will always be optional.

## Privacy & Security

### How does HeyZack handle my data?
Your privacy is a top priority. HeyZack processes data locally on your devices whenever possible. When cloud processing is necessary (such as for advanced AI features), your data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We never sell your personal data to third parties.

### Is my video footage stored securely?
Yes. Video from the doorbell camera and security cameras is encrypted and can be stored locally on an SD card or securely in the cloud. You control how long footage is stored and can delete it at any time.

### Can HeyZack be hacked?
We take security very seriously. HeyZack uses industry-standard encryption protocols, regular security updates, and has been designed with security best practices from the ground up. No system is 100% hack-proof, but we've implemented multiple layers of protection to keep your smart home secure.

## Kickstarter Campaign
